Dear reader, I'm ready to introduce you to my project!

I am a 2nd year college student in the IT field, focus on websites. This repository is my summer educational practice.

The teacher gave us a topic - make a website for a summer event in your favorite game.

The task itself:

1. Home - presentation of the event, information about the game, what gifts you can receive.

2. Login/Registration (access to page 3 is possible only through this page if the username and password are entered correctly (using JS))

3. Event Calendar - daily marks (30 days), daily and weekly tasks.

It must be adaptable to all types of devices, CSS animations appropriate for this event and game, and it is mandatory to use JS in addition to logging in.

I also added another additional page on my own behalf - "Rift-tour"

The site also has a script for registration/login, which saves the user's data in an array in localStorage during registration, and checks the user's entered data with the already saved array upon login. (I know that you can't do this, it's just to illustrate how these scripts work)

On all pages, there is a check that the user is logged into the account to access the calendar.

All assets (fonts, images, etc.) are taken from open sources, mention of trademarks and copyright Epic Games are present in the basement of the site.

The site demonstrates my abilities in website layout and is intended for commercial use.
